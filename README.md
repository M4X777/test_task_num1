# Test task
A program that works with SQLite database that organizes work with equipment on wells with the support of Swing Framework

The following functions are implemented:

1. Creation of N-number of equipment at the well. When selecting this item, the user specifies the number of equipment and the name of the well.
The program creates the specified number of equipment on the well with the specified name. When creating equipment, each is assigned its own id and its own unique name (it must be generated by the program using Latin letters and numbers). 
The well is also created by the program with the specified name, if it is not already in the table.

2. Output of general information about the equipment at the wells. When selecting this item, the user specifies the names of wells, separating them with spaces or commas. 
The program calculates the number of equipment at each well and displays a table of the type well NAME - number of equipment.

3. Export all data to an xml-file. When selecting this option, the user specifies the file name.
The program selects all wells from the database and records data on them and equipment in xml format in the form (the same well or equipment cannot be repeated several times)
